<!-- This is for all browsers that aren't chromium and aren't firefox -->
<p>
  I'm not quite sure what this browser is, so I don't know what to do with you!
  <br />
  If you know that your browser can install extensions from the Chrome
  Extension Store, please go here and install it! (Also, please reach out to
  me on twitter or something to update that your browser supports this)
  <br />
  If not, there's not much I can really do! If you're a developer, the core
  logic for this extension exists as an NPM package which you are free to use
  yourself. Otherwise, see the links below for supported browsers, or just
  feel free to use this site to convert your links when you need to.
