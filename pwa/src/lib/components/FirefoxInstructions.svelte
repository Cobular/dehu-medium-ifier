<p>
  Currently, the extension doesn't work on firefox!
  <br />
  It's Google's fault with their whole extension Manifest V3 stuff, which
  they're pushing very hard for adoption before the other browsers even
  support them at all :(
  <br />
  Anyway, this will be coming soonishâ„¢! Please check back in a few weeks.
  <br />
  In the meantime, consider taking a look at the automatic redirection
  instructions on the scribe.rip FAQ. Thank you!
